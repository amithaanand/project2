The code provided is a combination of different steps involving data processing, visualization, and an attempt at consuming messages from a Kafka topic
The script first loads and processes datasets, performs basic data inspection, visualizes data, and includes commented-out code for consuming messages from a Kafka topic. If uncommented, the Kafka consumer code would allow you to listen to a Kafka topic and process new messages (for example, orders being placed in an e-commerce system).
